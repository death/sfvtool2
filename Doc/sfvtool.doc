1. Overview
------------
SFVTool is a context menu shell extension to create/check SFV files.
SFVTool2 is a full rewrite. No more lame ass bugs (hopefully) and nicer
interface/features, also much faster.

2. Disclaimer
--------------
I'm not responsible for anything ;)


3. What to do?
---------------
Installation of the shell extension:
    1) Copy the DLL to wherever you want to install it
        (ex. C:\Windows\System, C:\Winnt\System32)
    2) Run REGSVR32 SFVTool2.DLL to register it

Uninstallation of the shell extension:
    1) Run REGSVR32 /u SFVTool2.dll to unregister it
    2) Delete SFVTool2.dll

Notice: SFVTool2 doesn't have the same GUID as SFVTool. If you upgrade
from SFVTool, it would be wise to uninstall it: REGSVR32 /u SFVTool.dll .


4. Technical notes
-------------------
I used Visual C++, STL and ATL libraries to write the shell extension.
